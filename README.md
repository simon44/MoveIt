# MoveIt
"Move it is an android running application that allows the user to register a run and have statistics about it and the map of his ride"

I did this project during my studies in Sweden during my Erasmus trip. I use this repo to keep track of this work. 

The main goal was to use several features of android environment : geolocalisation, google map, internal database, pickers etc.
